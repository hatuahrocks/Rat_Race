## üìñ Example Session

```
You: I need to analyze our monthly sales data and create a summary report

Claude: I'll help you analyze your sales data and create a summary report. 

Quick questions:
- What format is your sales data in? (Excel, CSV, database?)
- What kind of summary are you looking for? (totals by region, product, trends?)
- How would you like the report formatted? (Excel, PDF, email?)

You: It's in Excel, I need totals by region and product category, and I'd like it as a new Excel file with charts

Claude: Perfect! I'll create a tool that:
1. Reads your sales Excel file
2. Calculates totals by region and product category  
3. Creates charts to visualize the data
4. Saves everything to a new Excel file

[Claude creates and runs the solution]

Done! I've analyzed your sales data:
- Total sales: $1,234,567
- Top region: Northeast ($456,789)
- Top category: Electronics ($345,678)

Your summary report with charts is ready in 'sales_summary_202312.xlsx'
```
